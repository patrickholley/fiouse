This website is now offline and can no longer be viewed. However, a video walkthrough is available at the following URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzbGTRoMtpY&t=5s

This project was an exercise to see how well I could implement technologies I had little prior instruction in. I built this website after only a week of instruction in Angular 2, and this website makes pretty heavy use of Node and PostgreSQL also. I spent about two weeks working on it.

Fiouse is a website that allows companies to organize their employees into teams. Teams determine what level of permissions an employee will have within the company, such as the ability to edit other profiles and create new users.
